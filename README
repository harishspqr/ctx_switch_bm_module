This is a kernel module to benchmark the context swithcing time with as minimal overhead as possible. This tool has only 1 system call overhead per iteration which would equate to a context switch. 
Compiled against linux kernel version 4.2. 

2_processes\
	Supports only 2 proceses parent & child switching back and forth between each other. 

How to run:
make 
./test 

multiple_processes\
	Supports context switching between any number of children processes. 
How to run:
make 
./mmtest <No of processes>

When changes are done run make clean before running make. 

This is not known to work in SMP environment which would require additional locking(maybe for future).
