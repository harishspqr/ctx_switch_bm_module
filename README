This is a kernel module to benchmark the context swithcing time with as minimal overhead as possible. This tool has only 1 system call overhead per iteration which would equate to a context switch. 
Compiled against linux kernel version 4.2. 

2_processes\
	Supports only 2 proceses parent & child switching back and forth between each other.  

multiple_processes\
	Supports context switching between any number of children processes. 


This is not known to work in SMP environment which would require additional locking(maybe for future).
